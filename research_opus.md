## Round 1

### Opus Analysis

Analysis & Experiment Design

Current failure modes  
1. High recall / very low precision → LLM flooded with irrelevant memories; can’t isolate the needed fact.  
2. Preferences & multi-session questions fail → either facts not surfaced (preference extraction) or scattered across sessions without salience boosting.  
3. Temporal questions fail → recency/order not emphasised during retrieval or reasoning.

Key levers  
• Retrieval precision: top_k, similarity_threshold, rerank_strategy  
• Context focus: max_context_memories  
• Answer reasoning style: answer_strategy tuned to task type  
• Temporal weighting to push the newest / temporally-tagged memories upward

Hypotheses  
1. Adding entity_boost reranking PLUS a mild similarity filter (0.3-0.4) will cut noise while preserving recall, improving single-session-user, preference, and multi-session questions.  
2. Some wrong answers stem from too much context, not too little. A minimalist retrieval (top_k=5, no rerank, no threshold) will diagnose whether the model can answer when noise is minimal; if accuracy drops, recall is the bigger issue.  
3. Temporal-recency reranking with a strong temporal weight and a temporal-narrative answer prompt will improve temporal-reasoning and knowledge-update categories, even at very large top_k (breadth first, then aggressive rerank).

Experiments
1. Strong baseline: balanced recall/precision using entity boost + similarity filter; keep context manageable; CoT structured prompting.  
2. Diagnostic: tiny top_k, no rerank, concise answer; isolates effect of retrieval size.  
3. Aggressive/creative: very large retrieval, heavy temporal recency rerank, narrative temporal reasoning.
